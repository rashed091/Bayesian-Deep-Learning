    "<p>You might wish to define two Python functions, <code>sqexp_kernel_func</code> and <code>matern_kernel_func</code> to compute these kernels given any two possible inputs, <span class=\"math\">\\(x\\)</span> and <span class=\"math\">\\(x'\\)</span>. It is probably smart to write these functions in a vectorized form, so that given two vectors of length <span class=\"math\">\\(A\\)</span> and <span class=\"math\">\\(B\\)</span>, the function returns a kernel matrix of size <span class=\"math\">\\(A x B\\)</span>.</p>\n",

One way to generate a 1D array of <span class=\"math\">\\(G\\)</span> points would be: <code>x_grid_G = np.linspace(-20, 20, G)</code>. </p>\n",

    "<li>mean function equal to 0 </li>\n",
    "<li>covariance function (\"kernel\") which is specified as a Python function, which you can <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/706721/how-do-i-pass-a-method-as-a-parameter-in-python\">pass as the named \"cov_func\" argument below</a> </li>\n",
