## class GaussianVariational
### blitz.modules.weight_sampler.GaussianVariational(mu, rho)
Creates a weight sampler in order to introduce uncertainity on the layers weights.
#### Parameters:
  * mu - torch.tensor with two or more dimensions: mu parameter of the Gaussian weight sampler proposed on Bayes by Backprop paper
  * rho - torch.tensor with two or more dimensions: rho parameter of the Gaussian weight sampler proposed on Bayes by Backprop paper

#### Methods:
  * sample():
  
    Returns a torch.tensor corresponding to the sampled weights of the layer. Also stores the current distribution sigma and weights internally for further use.
  * log_posterior():
  
    Returns the torch.tensor corresponding to the summed log-likelihood of the sampled weights given its mu and sigma parameters, considering it follows a Gaussian distribution.

## class ScaleMixturePrior
### blitz.modules.weight_sampler.ScaleMixturePrior(pi, sigma1, sigma2)
Creates a log-likelihood calculator for any matrix w passed on the log_prior method, considering a Scaled Gaussian Mixture model of N(0, sigma1) with weight pi (parameter) and N(0, sigma2) with weight (1-pi) parameter, for each distribution, following the idea on Bayes by Backprop paper.
#### Parameters:
  * pi - float corresponding to a factor for scaling the mixture models
  * sigma1 - float corresponding to the standard deviation for the first Gaussian Model of the mixture
  * sigma2 - float corresponding to the standard deviation for the second Gaussian Model of the mixture

#### Methods:
  * log_prior(w):
  
    Returns the torch.tensor corresponding to the summed log-likelihood of the matrix of weights "w" given ScaleMixturePrior object scaled Gaussian Mixture model parameters.
    ##### Parameters:
      * w - torch.tensor
